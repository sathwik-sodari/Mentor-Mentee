    <p class="text-muted m-5" style="font-weight: bold;">   A mentor is someone who helps you grow your skills, make better decisions, and gain new perspectives on your life and career. As a mentee, your mentor will leverage their experience to give you guidance on your career or life now and in the future. 

     Rather than learning through trial and error, a mentor is a person you can look to for direction and a role model to imitate. </p>
